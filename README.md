# Hi, I'm Rachit Shah 👋

**Data Professional | Analytics & Pipeline Engineering | SQL · Python · Tableau · Automation**

I design end-to-end analytics solutions for credit risk, fraud detection, and busuness analysis, with a focus on reliability, automation, and clear business impact. My projects are full pipelines: SQL + Python models + monitoring + dashboards + static sites that someone can actually use.

---

## What I Do

- **Risk Analytics (Credit + Fraud)**  
  - Daily credit portfolio scoring (PD, EL)  
  - Fraud scoring API + rules engine  
  - Monitoring, drift, CI checks, audit packs

- **Data Analysis & BI**  
  - SQL-first analysis (PostgreSQL)  
  - Tableau dashboards for stakeholders  
  - Cohort, retention, and customer value analysis

- **Automation & Ops**  
  - Python flows + Windows Task Scheduler  
  - Static sites on Cloudflare Pages  
  - Clean repos with READMEs, guides, and demo scripts

If you’re a hiring manager: I’ve designed these projects to be **easy to review** and **easy to demo** in an interview.

## How I Work

- Prefer **SQL-first** analysis with clear questions and clean CTEs  
- Keep repos **interviewer-friendly**: structured READMEs, diagrams, and scripts  
- Automate whatever is repetitive: daily chains, reports, snapshots, alerts  
- Aim for **repeatable demos** — anyone should be able to follow the guides and see results

If you’re evaluating my profile:
- Start with the **Risk Analytics Flagship** repo + live site  
- Then check the **Contoso** and **Remote Job Market** dashboards  
- Everything is built to be walked through in a 15–30 minute interview.
